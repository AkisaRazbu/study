# Study.sh 
Simple bash script utilizing [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0) [timer](https://github.com/caarlos0/timer)

Requirements:
Caarlos0's timer, without it this won't even start! Installation for that is explained in the repo I linked above.

Installation:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/akisarazbu/study
$ cd study
$ sudo make
```
Usage:
```console
$ study [study_time] [pause_time]
```

You type study after that you enter 2 integers, first one being for how long do you want to study, second one being how long of a break are you taking after that.
Those integers are automatically considered as **MINUTES** there is no need to add m, s or any suffix after.
